Given that it was our task to control the robot with matlab, simulink was deemed to be the perfect tool to create a small GUI for this project.\\
As we were required to be able to draw different shapes, this GUI contains a switch, which enables the user to choose from a heart, square, or circle shape. Additionally, there are three sliders corresponding to the X, Y, and Z axes, in case users would like to take matters into their own hands. See the figure below for reference.\\
