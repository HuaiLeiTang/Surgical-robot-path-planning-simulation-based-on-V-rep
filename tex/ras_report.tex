\section*{Abbreviations and Acronyms}
Define abbreviations and acronyms - not sure if we need this?

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm} 
% This command serves to balance the column lengths
% on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
% the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
% This command does not take effect until the next page
% so it should come on the page before the last. Make
% sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{APPENDIX}

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment - keeping this section for god knows what...

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

Same...

I put the Master\rq s Thesis in the bibliography, wasn\rq t sure whether we needed anything else - maybe the Algorithm (that I  think) Miguel worked on.
