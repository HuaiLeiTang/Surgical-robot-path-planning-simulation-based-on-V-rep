documentation regarding vrep shared memory

both 
share memory base name and device number must be identical in vrep and simulink for communication to happen.

the sizes refer to how many bytes are shuffled through. a byte is 8 buts long. matlab is currently 64bit and vrep 3.2.x is 32bit. as a resulta single in matlab (32 bit) is a float in vrep, and should be declared as a float int the data inputs and outputs in the simulink block.
